# HoneB - DL based H1B visa prediction App

<b><i>The Problem Statement</b></i>: The number of people moving abroad in pursuit of higher-paying professions, reputable education, and modern surroundings have been increasing drastically each year. As a consequence the application for H1B visa have also increased in number drastically. Given the volume of applications, the likelihood of a visa being rejected is very high. Numerous American employers want to hire qualified foreign workers each year. Thousands of applicants still receive H-1B visa denials even though many are successful in bringing their new staff to the United States.

<b><i>The Solution Application</b></i>: The Flutter based cross platform mobile application uses the Django rest framework for its backend access where there is a Deep neural network based prediction model to predict the acceptance of H1B visa for the application user

<b>Deep Neural Network:</b> <br>
Number of Hidden Layers:5<br>
Activation Function for Hidden Layers:Relu<br>
Number of Output Layer:1<br>
Activation Function for Output Layer:Sigmoid<br>
Optimizer:Adam<br>
Loss Function:Binary crossentropy<br>

<i>The accuracy we got for deep neural network is 98%.</i>
